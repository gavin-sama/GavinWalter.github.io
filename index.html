                <h3><em>About Me</em></h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Gavin Walter, and I am a BlueSky Student attending East Tennessee State University (ETSU) at BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computing with a concentration in Information Systems.

                    I began the program in August 2023 and am on track to graduate by December 2025. Before this, I spent two years at Chattanooga State Community College in the Mechatronics Engineering program, where I gained hands-on experience in automation, control systems, and engineering principles.
                    
                    With a strong foundation in computing, data analytics, and engineering, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My current focus includes data cleansing, analytics, and information delivery, particularly in the healthcare industry.
                    
                    Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!
